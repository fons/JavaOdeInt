C
C     FCN         NAME (EXTERNAL) OF SUBROUTINE COMPUTING THE
C                 VALUE OF F(X,Y):
C                    SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,Y,F,RPAR,IPAR)
C                    DOUBLE PRECISION X,Y(N),F(N)
C                    F(1)=...   ETC.
C
C     X           INITIAL X-VALUE
C
C     Y(N)        INITIAL VALUES FOR Y
C
C     XEND        FINAL X-VALUE (XEND-X MAY BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE)
C
C     RTOL,ATOL   RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE ERROR TOLERANCES. THEY
C                 CAN BE BOTH SCALARS OR ELSE BOTH VECTORS OF LENGTH N.
C
C     ITOL        SWITCH FOR RTOL AND ATOL:
C                   ITOL=0: BOTH RTOL AND ATOL ARE SCALARS.
C                     THE CODE KEEPS, ROUGHLY, THE LOCAL ERROR OF
C                     Y(I) BELOW RTOL*ABS(Y(I))+ATOL
C                   ITOL=1: BOTH RTOL AND ATOL ARE VECTORS.
C                     THE CODE KEEPS THE LOCAL ERROR OF Y(I) BELOW
C                     RTOL(I)*ABS(Y(I))+ATOL(I).
C
C     SOLOUT      NAME (EXTERNAL) OF SUBROUTINE PROVIDING THE
C                 NUMERICAL SOLUTION DURING INTEGRATION. 
C                 IF IOUT.GE.1, IT IS CALLED AFTER EVERY SUCCESSFUL STEP.
C                 SUPPLY A DUMMY SUBROUTINE IF IOUT=0. 
C                 IT MUST HAVE THE FORM
C                    SUBROUTINE SOLOUT (NR,XOLD,X,Y,N,CON,ICOMP,ND,
C                                       RPAR,IPAR,IRTRN)
C                    DIMENSION Y(N),CON(5*ND),ICOMP(ND)
C                    ....  
C                 SOLOUT FURNISHES THE SOLUTION "Y" AT THE NR-TH
C                    GRID-POINT "X" (THEREBY THE INITIAL VALUE IS
C                    THE FIRST GRID-POINT).
C                 "XOLD" IS THE PRECEEDING GRID-POINT.
C                 "IRTRN" SERVES TO INTERRUPT THE INTEGRATION. IF IRTRN
C                    IS SET <0, DOPRI5 WILL RETURN TO THE CALLING PROGRAM.
C                    IF THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION IS ALTERED IN SOLOUT,
C                    SET  IRTRN = 2
C           
C          -----  CONTINUOUS OUTPUT: -----
C                 DURING CALLS TO "SOLOUT", A CONTINUOUS SOLUTION
C                 FOR THE INTERVAL [XOLD,X] IS AVAILABLE THROUGH
C                 THE FUNCTION
C                        >>>   CONTD5(I,S,CON,ICOMP,ND)   <<<
C                 WHICH PROVIDES AN APPROXIMATION TO THE I-TH
C                 COMPONENT OF THE SOLUTION AT THE POINT S. THE VALUE
C                 S SHOULD LIE IN THE INTERVAL [XOLD,X].
C
C     IOUT        SWITCH FOR CALLING THE SUBROUTINE SOLOUT:
C                    IOUT=0: SUBROUTINE IS NEVER CALLED
C                    IOUT=1: SUBROUTINE IS USED FOR OUTPUT.
C                    IOUT=2: DENSE OUTPUT IS PERFORMED IN SOLOUT
C                            (IN THIS CASE WORK(5) MUST BE SPECIFIED)
C
C     WORK        ARRAY OF WORKING SPACE OF LENGTH "LWORK".
C                 WORK(1),...,WORK(20) SERVE AS PARAMETERS FOR THE CODE.
C                 FOR STANDARD USE, SET THEM TO ZERO BEFORE CALLING.
C                 "LWORK" MUST BE AT LEAST  8*N+5*NRDENS+21
C                 WHERE  NRDENS = IWORK(5)
C
C     LWORK       DECLARED LENGHT OF ARRAY "WORK".
C
C     IWORK       INTEGER WORKING SPACE OF LENGHT "LIWORK".
C                 IWORK(1),...,IWORK(20) SERVE AS PARAMETERS FOR THE CODE.
C                 FOR STANDARD USE, SET THEM TO ZERO BEFORE CALLING.
C                 "LIWORK" MUST BE AT LEAST NRDENS+21 .
C
C     LIWORK      DECLARED LENGHT OF ARRAY "IWORK".
C
C     RPAR, IPAR  REAL AND INTEGER PARAMETERS (OR PARAMETER ARRAYS) WHICH  
C                 CAN BE USED FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOUR CALLING
C                 PROGRAM AND THE FCN, JAC, MAS, SOLOUT SUBROUTINES.

C     SOPHISTICATED SETTING OF PARAMETERS
C     -----------------------------------
C              SEVERAL PARAMETERS (WORK(1),...,IWORK(1),...) ALLOW
C              TO ADAPT THE CODE TO THE PROBLEM AND TO THE NEEDS OF
C              THE USER. FOR ZERO INPUT, THE CODE CHOOSES DEFAULT VALUES.
C
C    WORK(1)   UROUND, THE ROUNDING UNIT, DEFAULT 2.3D-16.
C
C    WORK(2)   THE SAFETY FACTOR IN STEP SIZE PREDICTION,

C
C    WORK(5)   IS THE "BETA" FOR STABILIZED STEP SIZE CONTROL
C              (SEE SECTION IV.2). LARGER VALUES OF BETA ( <= 0.1 )
C              MAKE THE STEP SIZE CONTROL MORE STABLE. DOPRI5 NEEDS
C              A LARGER BETA THAN HIGHAM & HALL. NEGATIVE WORK(5)
C              PROVOKE BETA=0.
C              DEFAULT 0.04D0.
C
C    WORK(6)   MAXIMAL STEP SIZE, DEFAULT XEND-X.
C
C    WORK(7)   INITIAL STEP SIZE, FOR WORK(7)=0.D0 AN INITIAL GUESS

C              AT THE MOMENT THIS IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE CHOICE.
C              THE DEFAULT VALUE (FOR IWORK(2)=0) IS IWORK(2)=1.
C

C              WRITE (IWORK(3),*) ...  
C              DEFAULT VALUE (FOR IWORK(3)=0) IS IWORK(3)=6
C
C    IWORK(4)  TEST FOR STIFFNESS IS ACTIVATED AFTER STEP NUMBER
C              J*IWORK(4) (J INTEGER), PROVIDED IWORK(4).GT.0.
C              FOR NEGATIVE IWORK(4) THE STIFFNESS TEST IS
C              NEVER ACTIVATED; DEFAULT VALUE IS IWORK(4)=1000
C
C    IWORK(5)  = NRDENS = NUMBER OF COMPONENTS, FOR WHICH DENSE OUTPUT
C              IS REQUIRED; DEFAULT VALUE IS IWORK(5)=0;
C              FOR   0 < NRDENS < N   THE COMPONENTS (FOR WHICH DENSE
C              OUTPUT IS REQUIRED) HAVE TO BE SPECIFIED IN
C              IWORK(21),...,IWORK(NRDENS+20);
C              FOR  NRDENS=N  THIS IS DONE BY THE CODE.
