C     ----------------------------------------------------------------
C     OVDRIV IS TO BE CALLED ONCE FOR EACH OUTPUT VALUE OF T, AND
C     IN TURN MAKES REPEATED CALLS TO THE CORE INTEGRATOR STIFF.
C
C     THE INPUT PARAMETERS ARE ..
C     N     =  THE NUMBER OF FIRST ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS.
C     T0    =  THE INITIAL VALUE OF T, THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE
C              (USED ONLY ON THE FIRST CALL)
C     HO    =  THE NEXT STEP SIZE IN T (USED FOR INPUT ONLY ON THE
C              FIRST CALL)
C     Y0    =  A VECTOR OF LENGTH N CONTAINING THE INITIAL VALUES OF Y
C              (USED FOR INPUT ONLY ON FIRST CALL)
C     YPRIME   A VECTOR OF LENGTH N CONTAINING THE INITIAL VALUES OF
C              DY/DT
C     TOUT  =  THE VALUE OF T AT WHICH OUTPUT IS DESIRED NEXT.
C              INTEGRATION WILL NORMALLY GO SLIGHTLY BEYOND TOUT
C              AND THE PACKAGE WILL INTERPOLATE TO T = TOUT
C     TEND  =  END OF THE RANGE OF INTEGRATION.
C     MF    =  THE METHOD FLAG.  AT PRESENT MF=21,22,23 OR 24 IS
C              ALLOWED. THESE ARE EXTENDED BACKWARD DIFFERENTIATION
C              FORMULAE USING THE CHORD METHOD WITH ANALYTIC OR NUMERICAL
C              JACOBIAN FOR MF=21,22 RESPECTIVELY. MF=23/24 ARE  THE SAME
C              AS FOR 21/22 BUT THE JACOBIAN IS NOW BANDED.   THE USER
C              NEEDS TO SPECIFY SUBROUTINE PDERV IF MF=21 OR 23.
C     IDID   = THE INTEGER USED ON INPUT TO INDICATE THE TYPE OF CALL.
C              1   THIS IS THE FIRST CALL FOR THE PROBLEM.
C              0   THIS IS NOT THE FIRST CALL FOR THIS PROBLEM
C                  AND INTEGRATION IS TO CONTINUE.
C             -1   THIS IS NOT THE FIRST CALL FOR THE PROBLEM,
C                  AND THE USER HAS RESET N, RTOL, ATOL,H  AND/OR MF.
C              2   SAME AS 0 EXCEPT THAT TOUT HAS TO BE HIT
C                  EXACTLY (NO INTERPOLATION IS DONE).
C                  ASSUMES TOUT .GE. THE CURRENT T.
C              3   SAME AS 0 EXCEPT CONTROL RETURNS TO CALLING
C                  PROGRAM AFTER ONE STEP. TOUT IS IGNORED, UNTIL THE
C                  INTEGRATION REACHES TOUT OR BEYOND. IF IT PASSES TOUT
C                  THE PROGRAM INTERPOLATES THE SOLUTION VALUES AND
C                  RETURNS THE SOLUTION VALUE AT TOUT.
C              SINCE THE NORMAL OUTPUT VALUE OF IDID IS 0,
C              IT NEED NOT BE RESET FOR NORMAL CONTINUATION.
C              THE FIRST CALL TO THE DRIVER IS WITH IDID=1 AND FOR
C              A SUCCESSFUL STEP THE DRIVER RETURNS WITH IDID=1.THUS
C              THE CALL WITH IDID = 1 IS SIMPLY THE FIRST
C              INITIALISING STEP FOR THE CODE.  THE USER
C              THEN NEEDS TO CONTINUE WITH IDID=0,-1,2 OR 3 AS ABOVE.
C     LOUT   = THE LOGICAL OUTPUT CHANNEL FOR MESSAGE PASSING.
C     MBND   = AN ARRAY OF DIMENSION 4 FOR USE WHEN THE NEWTON ITERATION
C              MATRIX IS BANDED.  IF THIS MATRIX HAS ML DIAGONALS
C              BELOW THE MAIN DIAGONAL AND MU DIAGONALS ABOVE THE
C              MAIN DIAGONAL THEN:
C              MBND(1) = ML
C              MBND(2) = MU
C              MBND(3) = MU + ML + 1
C              MBND(4) = 2*ML + MU + 1
C     MAXDER=  THE MAXIMUM ORDER IS MAXDER + 1.
C              THE VALUE OF MAXDER CANNOT EXCEED 7.  THIS IS THE
C              VALUE RECOMMENDED UNLESS IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE
C              ARE SEVERE STABILITY PROBLEMS IN WHICH CASE MAXDER=3
C              OR 4 SHOULD BE TRIED INSTEAD.
C     ITOL  =  AN INDICATOR OF THE TYPE OF ERROR CONTROL. SEE
C              DESCRIPTION BELOW UNDER ATOL.
C     RTOL  =  A RELATIVE ERROR TOLERANCE PARAMETER. CAN BE EITHER A
C              SCALAR OR AN ARRAY OF LENGTH N.  SEE DESCRIPTION
C              BELOW UNDER ATOL.
C     ATOL  =  THE ABSOLUTE ERROR BOUND.
C              THE INPUT PARAMETERS ITOL, RTOL AND ATOL DETERMINE
C              THE ERROR CONTROL PERFORMED BY THE SOLVER.  THE
C              SOLVER WILL CONTROL THE VECTOR e = (e(i)) OF ESTIMATED
C              LOCAL ERRORS IN y ACCORDING TO AN INEQUALITY OF THE FORM
C                  RMS-NORM OF (e(i)/ewt(i)) .LE. 1
C              THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE NORM IS
C                   RMS-NORM(V) = SQRT((SUM v(i)**2)/N).  HERE
C                ewt = (ewt(i)) IS A VECTOR OF WEIGHTS WHICH MUST
C              ALWAYS BE POSITIVE, AND THE VALUES OF RTOL AND ATOL
C              SHOULD BE NON-NEGATIVE. IF ITOL = 1 THEN SINGLE STEP ERROR
C              ESTIMATES DIVIDED BY YMAX(I) WILL BE KEPT LESS THAN 1
C              IN ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE NORM.  THE VECTOR YMAX OF WEIGHTS IS
C              COMPUTED IN OVDRIV. INITIALLY YMAX(I) IS SET AS
C              THE MAXIMUM OF 1 AND ABS(Y(I)).  THEREAFTER YMAX(I) IS
C              THE LARGEST VALUE OF ABS(Y(I)) SEEN SO FAR, OR THE
C              INITIAL VALUE YMAX(I) IF THAT IS LARGER.
C              IF ITOL = 1 THE USER NEEDS TO SET ATOL = RTOL =
C              THE PRECISION REQUIRED.  THEN
C                         ewt(i) = RTOL(1)*YMAX(i)
C              IF ITOL IS GREATER THAN 1 THEN
C                 ewt(i) = rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)
C              THE FOLLOWING TABLE GIVES THE TYPES (SCALAR/ARRAY)
C              OF RTOL AND ATOL, AND THE CORRESPONDING FORM OF ewt(i)
C                  ITOL   RTOL      ATOL       ewt(i)
C                   2    SCALAR    SCALAR   rtol*abs(y(i))   + atol
C                   3    SCALAR    ARRAY    rtol*abs(y(i))   + atol(i)
C                   4    ARRAY     SCALAR   rtol(i)*abs(y(i))+ atol
C                   5    ARRAY     ARRAY    rtol(i)*abs(y(i))+ atol(i)
C              IF EITHER OF THESE PARAMETERS IS A SCALAR, IT NEED
C              NOT BE DIMENSIONED IN THE USER'S CALLING PROGRAM.
C     NIND1    = THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES OF INDEX 1,2,3 RESPECTIVELY.
C     NIND2,NIND3  THESE ARE SET IN IWORK(1),(2),(3).
C              THE EQUATIONS MUST BE DEFINED SO THAT THE INDEX 1
C              VARIABLES PRECEDE THE INDEX 2 VARIABLES WHICH IN
C              TURN PRECEDE THE INDEX 3 VARIABLES.
C     RPAR, IPAR  REAL AND INTEGER PARAMETERS (OR PARAMETER ARRAYS)
C              WHICH CAN BE USED FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN  THE USER'S
C              CALLING PROGRAM AND THE F AND PDERV SUBROUTINES.
C     IERR     IERR IS AN INTEGER FLAG WHICH IS ALWAYS EQUAL TO ZERO
C              ON INPUT.  SUBROUTINES F AND PDERV SHOULD ALTER
C              IERR ONLY IF ONE OF THEM ENCOUNTERS AN ILLEGAL OPERATION SUCH
C              AS THE SQUARE ROOT OF A NEGATIVE NUMBER OR EXPONENT
C              OVERFLOW. THE USER CAN THEN ALTER H AND CALL THE
C              SUBROUTINE AGAIN WITH IDID=-1 IF HE WISHES.
C
C     AFTER THE INITIAL CALL, IF A NORMAL RETURN OCCURED AND A NORMAL
C     CONTINUATION IS DESIRED, SIMPLY RESET TOUT AND CALL AGAIN.
C     ALL OTHER PARAMETERS WILL BE READY FOR THE NEXT CALL.
C     A CHANGE OF PARAMETERS WITH IDID = -1 CAN BE MADE AFTER
C     EITHER A SUCCESSFUL OR AN UNSUCCESSFUL RETURN.
C
C     THE OUTPUT PARAMETERS ARE..
C     T0    =  THE VALUE OF T WHICH RELATES TO THE CURRENT SOLUTION
C              POINT Y0()
C     HO    =  THE STEPSIZE H USED LAST, WHETHER SUCCESSFULLY OR NOT.
C     Y0    =  THE COMPUTED VALUES OF Y AT T = TOUT
C     YPRIME=  THE COMPUTED VALUES OF DY/DT AT T=TOUT.
C     TOUT  =  UNCHANGED FROM ITS INPUT VALUE.
C     IDID  =  INTEGER USED ON OUTPUT TO INDICATE RESULTS, WITH
C              THE FOLLOWING VALUES AND MEANINGS..
C
C      0   INTEGRATION WAS COMPLETED TO TOUT OR BEYOND.
C
C     -1   THE INTEGRATION WAS HALTED AFTER FAILING TO PASS THE
C          ERROR TEST EVEN AFTER REDUCING H BY A FACTOR OF
C          1.E10 FROM ITS INITIAL VALUE.
C
C     -2   AFTER SOME INITIAL SUCCESS, THE INTEGRATION WAS
C          HALTED EITHER BY REPEATED ERROR TEST FAILURES OR BY
C          A TEST ON RTOL/ATOL.  TOO MUCH ACCURACY HAS BEEN REQUESTED.
C
C     -3   THE INTEGRATION WAS HALTED AFTER FAILING TO ACHIEVE
C          CORRECTOR CONVERGENCE EVEN AFTER REDUCING H BY A
C          FACTOR OF 1.E10 FROM ITS INITIAL VALUE.
C
C     -4   IMMEDIATE HALT BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL VALUES OF INPUT
C          PARAMETERS.  SEE PRINTED MESSAGE.
C
C     -5   IDID WAS -1 ON INPUT, BUT THE DESIRED CHANGES OF
C          PARAMETERS WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE TOUT
C          WAS NOT BEYOND T.  INTERPOLATION AT T = TOUT WAS
C          PERFORMED AS ON A NORMAL RETURN.  TO TRY AGAIN,
C          SIMPLY CALL AGAIN WITH IDID = -1 AND A NEW TOUT.
C
C     -6   MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE NUMBER OF INTEGRATION STEPS EXCEEDED.
C          TO CONTINUE THE USER SHOULD RESET IWORK(14).
C
C
C     -7   STEPSIZE IS TOO SMALL (LESS THAN SQRT(UROUND)/100)
C
C 
C     -11   INSUFFICIENT REAL WORKSPACE FOR THE INTEGRATION
C
C     -12   INSUFFICIENT INTEGER WORKSPACE FOR THE INTEGRATION
C
C
C     IN ADDITION TO OVDRIVE, THE FOLLOWING ROUTINES ARE PROVIDED
C     IN THE PACKAGE..
C
C     INTERP( - )   INTERPOLATES TO GET THE OUTPUT VALUES
C                   AT T=TOUT FROM THE DATA IN THE Y ARRAY.
C     STIFF( - )    IS THE CORE INTEGRATOR ROUTINE.  IT PERFORMS A

C     DGBFA ( - )   FACTORS A DOUBLE PRECISION BAND MATRIX BY
C                   ELIMINATION.
C     DGBSL ( - )   SOLVES A BANDED LINEAR SYSTEM A*x=b
C
C                   ALSO SUPPLIED ARE THE BLAS ROUTINES
C
C                   daxpy, dscal, idamax, ddot.
C
C
C     THE FOLLOWING ROUTINES ARE TO BE SUPPLIED BY THE USER AND
C                   SHOULD BE DECLARED AS EXTERNAL.
C
C     PDERV(T,Y,PD,N,YPRIME,MBND(4),CON,IPAR,RPAR,IERR)  
C                         COMPUTES THE N*N NEWTON ITERATION MATRIX
C                         OF PARTIAL DERIVATIVES PD=DG/DY + c(DG/DY') 
C                         WHERE c IS A SCALAR.  IF A NUMERICAL
C                         JACOBIAN IS REQUIRED (MF=22 OR 24) THEN THIS 
C                         SUBROUTINE CAN BE A DUMMY ONE. THE ITERATION 
C                         MATRIX IS STORED AS AN N BY N ARRAY IF THE 
C                         MATRIX IS FULL.  IF THE ITERATION MATRIX IS 
C                         BANDED THE ARRAY PD IS OF SIZE MBND(4)*N. 
C                         IF THE ITERATION MATRIX IS FULL, PD(I,J) IS  
C                         TO BE SET TO THE PARTIAL DERIVATIVE OF THE 
C                         ith COMPONENT OF G(t,Y,Y') WITH
C                         RESPECT TO Y(J).  IF THE JACOBIAN IS BANDED
C                         WITH mu DIAGONALS ABOVE THE MAIN DIAGONAL
C                         THE PARTIAL DERIVATIVE OF THE ith COMPONENT
C                         OF G(t,Y,Y') WITH RESPECT TO Y(J) SHOULD BE
C                         PUT IN PD(i-j+mu+1,j). PDERV IS CALLED ONLY IF
C                         MITER = 1 OR 3.  OTHERWISE A DUMMY ROUTINE CAN
C                         BE SUBSTITUTED.
C
C     THE DIMENSION OF PD  MUST BE AT LEAST N**2 FOR A FULL ITERATION
C     MATRIX AND MBND(4)*N FOR A BANDED ITERATION MATRIX
C     (MF=23 OR 24) .  THE DIMENSIONS
C     OF YMAX,ERROR,SAVE1,SAVE2,IPIV AND THE FIRST DIMENSION
C     OF Y SHOULD ALL BE AT LEAST N.
C
C     RESID(N,T,Y,DELTA,YPRIME,IPAR,RPAR,IERR)
C                          COMPUTES THE RESIDUAL VECTOR
C                          DELTA = G(T,Y,Y').
C
C
C     UROUND   THIS IS THE UNIT ROUNDOFF AND HAS TO BE SET AS
C                        UROUND = DLAMCH('Epsilon')
C     EPSJAC   = sqrt(UROUND).
C
